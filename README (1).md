# Design and Development of Snake Recognition System

#### Snakebite envenoming is a neglected tropical disease that kills an estimated 81,000 to 138,000 people and disables another 400,000 globally every year. The World Health Organization aims to halve this burden by 2030. To achieve this ambitious goal, we need to close the data gap in snake ecology and snakebite epidemiology and give healthcare providers up-to-date knowledge and access to better diagnostic tools. An essential first step is to improve the capacity to identify biting snakes taxonomically. The existence of AI-based identification tools for other animals offers an innovative opportunity to apply machine learning to snake identification and snakebite envenoming, a life-threatening situation.                                                                                                                           

#### In response to the global threat posed by snakebite envenoming, our project, the 'Snake Recognition System,' leverages advanced machine learning techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to identify whether a snake is venomous or non-venomous based on the images of that snake. By utilizing a dataset of venomous and non-venomous snake images, our system employs state-of-the-art algorithms to accurately differentiate between the two categories. Utilizing Python, Django, and AI technologies, we have developed a user-friendly web interface that enables individuals to upload snake images and receive predictions. This innovative solution harnesses the power of technology to enhance snake safety, prevention, and awareness, making a significant impact on public health.
